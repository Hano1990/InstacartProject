# InstacartProject-Python
## Introducation
Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app.
## Objective
Instacart already has very good sales, but they wanted to uncover more information about their sales patterns. I performed an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and recommend strategies for better segmentation based on the criteria they provided.
## Data sets Used
- Orders
- Products
- Departments
- Customers
